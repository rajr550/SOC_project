# Al-Gore-Rhythmic-Ascent

*Summer of Science (SoC) 2025 ‚Äî Mid-Term Report*

Welcome to the official repository of *Al-Gore-Rhythmic-Ascent, a project undertaken as part of the *Summer of Science initiative. This project focuses on strengthening problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking through structured learning in competitive programming.

## üìå Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a solid foundation in:
- Data structures and algorithms
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Competitive programming techniques
- Mathematical concepts relevant to problem-solving

## üìÖ Progress Summary (Weeks 1‚Äì4)

### *Week 1: Foundations*
- Implemented a Vec3 class to practice object-oriented programming.
- Learned time complexity concepts and benchmarking.
- Studied basic data structures: Arrays, Vectors, Stacks, Queues.
- Solved practice problems to apply these concepts.

### *Week 2: Data Structures & Sorting*
- Explored Linked Lists, Hash Maps, and Trees.
- Implemented classic sorting algorithms.
- Analyzed time and space complexity of each.

### *Week 3: Searching & CP Templates*
- Studied searching algorithms:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
  - Exponential Search
- Learned BFS and DFS for graphs.
- Designed custom templates for competitive programming.
- Referred to Skiena‚Äôs Algorithm Design Manual for insights.

### *Week 4: Math & Greedy Techniques*
- Based on the CP Handbook:
  - Chapter 21: Number Theory
  - Chapter 22: Combinatorics
  - Chapter 24: Probability
  - Chapter 6: Greedy Strategies
- Topics included:
  - Modular Arithmetic
  - Binary Exponentiation
  - Expected Value
  - Greedy Algorithms

### *week 5: Dynamic programming*
Grasp the fundamental ideas behind Dynamic Programming (DP).
Learn to recognize DP patterns during problem-solving.
Handbook
üîç Focus on defining DP states clearly, formulating state transitions, and understanding both memoization (top-down) and tabulation (bottom-up) strategies.
üîç Practice both recursive and iterative approaches to implementing DP solutions.

### *week 7: creating my own data structure*
I built my own data structure called MedianStack. 
It works like a normal stack but can also return the median of elements in O(1) time using a multiset
